There are chiefly three different types of glass which can be used on watches: acrylic, mineral (glass), and sapphire. Some materials are more expensive than others, but all have different properties which potentially render them equally useful as long as you understand the advantages and limitations of each.

### Most Shatter-Resistant: Acrylic
__VICKERS HARDNESS RANGE: 20-500__

Cheap to buy but hard to break, acrylic was the first material used in standard issue military watches.

<p class="product-image"><img src="/images/posts/watches/wargame-theory-review-window-demystified-watch-1.jpg" alt="Armitron Watch With Acrylic Window"></p>

__THE GOOD__ Among each of the options for window glass, you can’t beat acrylic for its flexibility. It’s more shatter resistant than even the most expensive materials and scratches can even be buffed out with toothpaste.

__THE BAD__ Acrylic crystals are, hands down, the easiest types to scratch. They don’t take well to a good raking, and will render the watch unreadable over time after accumulated abuse if not maintained.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ Acrylic stands as a solid contender if shatter resistance is important to you and you don’t mind buffing the face as you go. Usually featured on cheap watches (though there are notable exceptions), the price point of acrylic crystal usually lends itself to an easily replaced watch or window.

### Most Scratch-Resistant: Mineral
__VICKERS HARDNESS RANGE: 600-800__

Tempered glass provides a middle ground between price, scratch resistance, and flexibility.

{% include product-rating.html content="Overall Rating:7.5, Shatter Resistance:7, Vickers Hardness Range:8" %} 
<p class="product-image"><img src="/images/posts/watches/wargame-theory-review-window-demystified-watch-2.jpg" alt="Casio Watch With Mineral Window"></p>

__THE GOOD__ More difficult to scratch than plastic but easier to shatter, glass has become the most common material for watch windows by the industry due to its price and the reduced need for user maintenance.

__THE BAD__ Glass is difficult to buff, so the scratches that make it on the watch are usually there to stay. It’s not as shatter resistant as acrylic but still scratches easier than sapphire so care should needs to be exercised for longevity.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ The middle road for watches, it takes user maintenance out of the picture by providing a better chance to prevent damage in the first place. Keep your eye out for proprietary glass such as Hardlex from Seiko which provide even more resistance to scratching and shattering than the average glass window.

### Most Scratch & Shatter-Resistant: Sapphire
__VICKERS HARDNESS RANGE: 2000-2200__

A defining characteristic of an expensive watch, this material can take both the hammer and the rake and still save face.

{% include product-rating.html content="Overall Rating:9.5, Shatter Resistance:10, Vickers Hardness Range:9" %} 
<p class="product-image"><img src="/images/posts/watches/wargame-theory-review-window-demystified-watch-3.jpg" alt="Casio Watch With Sapphire Window"></p>

__THE GOOD__ You won’t find better scratch resistance on a watch window unless you manage to fashion one of out of diamond. But at that point you might as well buy several watches with sapphire and call it a day. 

__THE BAD__ Such a high hardness rating can occasionally lend itself to brittleness. At just the right angle with just the right material, it’s possible for the window to shatter.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ Such a high quality window isn’t featured on cheaper watches because the watch will break before it does! Though it’s the most expensive type of watch crystal regularly manufactured, it lives up to the hype - if you can survive the price tag of the watches it’s usually featured on.
