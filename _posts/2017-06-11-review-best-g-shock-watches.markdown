Since their introduction to the market in 1983, G-Shock (short for Gravitational Shock) have always been about maximizing durability and were specifically built for users in need of a highly functional watch.
 
__IMMEDIATELY PROVEN__ to be a sensation among those in the military, law enforcement, and athletes, Casio’s new line of watches surged in popularity and continued to grow to the respectable brand that we recognize today.
 
While the G-Shock series has certainly altered its features and form as time has moved forward, the commitment of its engineers to develop products that can survive in virtually any environment has never changed.
 
Though they all share the quality of reasonable indestructibility, there are many different models available which have been produced over the years.
 
Today, there are still a bewildering amount of models to choose from. We’ve taken the liberty to look at them and let you know what the best watches are for your individual needs.

### Best Overall: G-Shock Solar Black Resin Watch

With features such as self-updating atomic time calibration and solar powered batteries, the life expectancy of this watch is at least a decade.

</p>

__THE GOOD__ The GW6900-1 self updates with atomic time and allows the user to focus on actually using the functions of the watch without worrying about any reduction in battery life. Backed up with the typical durability of the G-Shock series, this watch is one that will never require manual adjustment and as such features the optimal maintenance-free experience.

__THE BAD__ The battery of the watch has a finite life of approximately 10 years. However, the replacement battery will cost under $25.00. Also, some users have reported that keeping the battery on a low charge for months at a time will harm the maximum battery life available.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ For the price of two of the cheapest G-Shock watches, you can have one which self updates and has the means to use all of its functions while maintaining a battery life which is more than double the non-solar powered models. Eliminating all required user maintenance makes this watch an outstanding pick if you want a no-fuss functional timepiece without sacrificing reliability.

### Most Durable: G-Shock Mudmaster Sapphire Watch

Made of the best materials and most durable components, this is the pinnacle of G-Shock indestructibility and not for the faint of heart.

{% include product-rating.html content="Overall Rating:9.3, Functionality:8, Battery Life:10, Durability:10" %}

</p>

__THE GOOD__ Featuring sapphire crystal, a whole suite of useful features, and a solar battery, this achievement of mankind is something that will live long enough to pass down to later generations. The watch includes an altimeter, barometer, thermometer, electronic compass, self updating atomic time, and a level of construction built to withstand the toughest of environments.

__THE BAD__ Just as it’s not meant for the faint in heart, it’s not for the faint of cash either. The price premium over some of the other models such as the G-Shock Rangeman for the extra features (sapphire window, atomic time, and illuminated hands) may leave some questioning the proportional benefit over the cost.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ The toughest of the toughest, the Mudmaster GWG-1000-1AJF is one mean machine that can withstand a mountain, desert, and jungle worth of abuse. Foregoing smart technology in favor of unabashed survivability, this is the watch you’ll want at your side when the grid disappears and survival is the name of the game.

### Best Features: G-Shock Protrek Smart Quartz Watch

The go-to smart watch for those looking for the ultimate marriage of brains and brawn.

{% include product-rating.html content="Overall Rating:7.3, Functionality:10, Battery Life:6, Durability:6" %}

</p>

__THE GOOD__ Complete with GPS, Android wear 2.0, a digital compass, and the suite of other features expected out of a top notch smart watch, it even meets military standards for durability under MIL-STD-810G. 

__THE BAD__ A common problem among smart watches, the battery life drains very quickly with use. It lasts up to two days of use with the Auto Color function off, but only one day with all functions available. And those numbers only go down when the GPS is turned on. To compensate for this, the battery will last up to a month with only the timekeeping mode on, but at that point you might as well get a cheaper watch. Also, it has glass for its window instead the stronger sapphire lens. This makes it more susceptible to scratches and shattering, though is cheaper to replace if something very unfortunate were to happen.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ If you’re looking for a one stop watch that can connect to the online world via wifi, bluetooth, and multinational GPS networks (includes GLONASS and Michibiki compatibility) and won’t be destroyed if a rock looks at it funny, the WSD-F20 is a solid choice. Despite its low rating in comparable durability against the other G-Shocks, it must be considered that the watch is inherently more sensitive because of its electronics and isn’t intended for the same type of abuse as the others reviewed in this article.

### Best Budget: G-Shock Sport Watch

Trusted by our brothers and sisters in the armed services, this watch is reliable enough for combat conditions and cheap enough to be replaced without concern.

<p class="product-image" markdown="1">

</p>

__THE GOOD__ For all the basic functions of an electronic watch, two years of estimated battery life (though many users report up to twice that), and a design born out of prototypes being thrown out of three story windows, there really isn’t much to complain about. It also comes with the standard 200m water resistance that we’ve come to expect from G-Shocks.

__THE BAD__ Occasionally, users have complained about the band’s strength. Purchasing and installing a replacement band, which can be done for under $15.00, fixes the issue.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ When you need something tough that won’t eat a hole in your wallet, this is where you should start your search. It is affordable enough to avoid shedding tears if it breaks and as such is a very risk free investment in a timepiece. It was built with abusive conditions in mind, so do not be afraid to use it accordingly.
