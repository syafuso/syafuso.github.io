### Best Overall: Casio G-Shock Black Resin Sport Watch

Durable enough to withstand combat, yet cheap enough to risk it, this watch will deliver what you need at a great price.

__THE GOOD__ This watch represents the ultimate combination of durability, functionality, ease of use, and price. Coming in at under $50.00, this watch is water resistant up to 200m and can take a hell of a beating before it goes down.

__THE BAD__ The wristband isn’t as strong as the more expensive G-Shock models, but replacement straps are bought cheaply enough at under $15.00.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ While not technically as durable as the GG-1000-1A3CR, it’s a quarter of the price and as tough as a pile of bricks. Tried & trusted by members in the military, you really can’t go wrong if you’re looking for something that can survive a fall better than you can.

__THE GOOD__ Featuring a face that reeks of tactical professionalism, this watch is readable in day or night due to its illuminated hands. Very readable no matter what conditions you’re in, it will quickly tell you the precise time and look amazing while doing it.

__THE BAD__ Users have reported incidents of the watch breaking from falls a few feet above the ground and the pins holding the straps coming loose.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ Easily one of the classiest watches out there, it tells you the time with no fuss and with no need for push button lights. It’s very lightweight and has an impressive pedigree due to its use from Navy Seals and law enforcement.

</p>

__THE GOOD__ Quartz precision on a platform trusted by military members. High quality timekeeping and features illuminated hands for easy reading in the day or night. It’s proprietary Hardlex mineral window features the best in class impact resistance and scratch resistance for its type.

__THE BAD__ With 100m water resistance, it is inevitable that the SNZG15 will be rated lower than the other watches listed here in terms of durability.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ If you’re looking for a quality watch that can stand up to an active lifestyle while maintaining that classic military look, look no further. The Seiko is your boy!

### Quick Buying Tips

__WELL-DESIGNED FACES__ are easy to read regardless of lighting conditions, contain bold numbers for quick recognition, and typically draw from a darker color palette.

Ever since their introduction into the armed forces in World War I, watches in the military style have typically emphasized a classy but no-frills approach to the business of timekeeping. 
 
__CLASSIC BRANDS__ include Casio and Timex, which are very popular with the US military. Both have developed product lines with a great reputation for their durability, ease of use, and functionality.
