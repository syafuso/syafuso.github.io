Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter.

&lt;p&gt;In his infamous collection of proverbs known as “The Art of War”, Sun Tzu spends much time discussing the importance of being unpredictable in deadly ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote the man:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining the battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.” (The Art of War, Sun Tzu, Chapter V: Energy, Paragraph 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/test.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Test Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not About the Bigger Guns or the Better Tactics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does he mean by “indirect methods?”
I can assure you of at least one thing - definitely not just artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he’s getting at is that there always needs to be a clever hook in your plan that your opponent didn’t see coming. You need to misdirect and confuse your enemy with something that appears significant, then deliver the killing blow from a different angle or method while their attention is focused elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winning a clear victory isn’t as simple as maintaining an army with superior combat power. It’s about multiplying your own in ways your opponent doesn’t expect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assisting Your Enemy’s Flight - A Lesson in Deception&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the good old days of 219 AD, two warlords named Liu Bei and Cao Cao faced off in what was to be called the Battle of the Han River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous engagement, Liu Bei’s forces had succeeded in inflicting a massive blow to Cao Cao in a pitched battle which ended with one of Cao Cao’s generals being killed in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greatly upset at the loss, Cao Cao took a large host of men numbering between 40,000 to 50,000 to attack Liu Bei’s main base south of the Han River. Unfortunately for Liu Bei, his forces numbered only in the range 10,000 to 20,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liu Bei’s general, Zhao Yun, was responsible for the camp’s defense. But how was he supposed to defend against such a larger force?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhao Yun’s subordinate commander advised to close the gates, reasoning that the best combat multiplier to be gained was in using the fortifications in a static defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Zhao Yun had something else in mind. He immediately ordered all the drums to be silenced, the banners taken down from the walls, and the gates be left completely open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then concealed all of his available archers into a wooded area nearby outside of the fortress and waited for the enemy’s advance while personally standing outside of the open gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cao Cao’s vastly superior force stopped their march upon seeing the absolutely unexpected sight. Bewildered and suspicious of an ambush, Cao Cao pulled his men back by ordering a retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon seeing this, Zhao Yun immediately ordered the war drums to be beat as loudly as possible and his concealed archers immediately loosed their ammunition on the backs of the retreating enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retreat turned into a route as panicked men tried to flee the kill zone established by the archers in the wood. Disorder and chaos reigned in Cao Cao’s army as Zhao Yun ordered his men to pursue the disheartened enemy troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the rest of Liu Bei’s forces capitalized on Zhao Yun’s victory by cornering Cao Coa’s army and pushing it further towards the Han River. In the resulting confusion and route, many men were pushed into the rushing river and drowned which heralded the victory of Liu Bei’s military campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In Summary - Focus on Tempo!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Zhao Yun did was obviously brilliant, but it was based off of the simple principle of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By throwing something completely unexpected in the way of the enemy commander, Zhao Yun made his opponent reconsider his move and put him on the defensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cao Cao suddenly didn’t know what he was walking into, and that hesitation was all Zhao Yun needed to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about different ways you can defy or manage your enemy’s expectations. Bend those assumptions to your benefit and you will find an opportunity everywhere you look.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kevin Boehle</name></author><summary type="html">Today, we’ll take a dive into something difficult to prepare against and possibly bewildering… Because that something is surprise!
