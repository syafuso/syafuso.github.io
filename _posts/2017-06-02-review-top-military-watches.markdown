### Best Overall: Casio G-Shock Men's Black Resin Sport Watch

Durable enough to withstand combat, yet cheap enough to risk it, this watch will deliver what you need at a bargain.

{% include product-rating.html content="Overall Rating:9, Durability:9, Functionality:9, Ease of Use:9, Readability:9" %} 
<p class="product-image"><img src="/images/posts/wargame-theory-review-best-military-watch-1.jpg" alt="G-Shock Black Resin Watch" /></p>

__THE GOOD__ This watch represents the ultimate crossroads of durability, functionality, ease of use, and price. Coming in at under $50.00, this watch is water resistant up to 200m and can take a hell of a beating before it goes down.

__THE BAD__ The wristband isn’t as strong as the more expensive G-Shock models, but replacement straps are bought cheaply enough at under $15.00.

__THE BOTTOM LINE__ While not technically as durable as the GG-1000-1A3CR, it’s a quarter of the price and as tough as a pile of bricks. Tried & trusted by members in the military, you really can’t go wrong if you’re looking for something that can survive falls better than you can.
